Scenario 1: Test Return Description When Directory is Present Only in the First Snapshot
  Details:
    TestName: testDirPresentInFirstSnapshot.
    Description: This test checks if the method correctly returns the description when a directory is present only in the first snapshot.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up firstSnapshot and secondSnapshot as two distinct Snapshot instances; this should be empty or doesn't contain the same directory.
    Act: Call getDescription with DIR_PRESENT_IN_FIRST_SNAPSHOT_ONLY as the Target Enum and the two snapshots as parameters.
    Assert: Assert that the returned description is "Directory is present in [firstSnapshot] snapshot only:".
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the description correctly indicates that the directory is only in the first snapshot. This is crucial in the application for identifying discrepancies between snapshots.

Scenario 2: Test Return Description When Directory is Present Only in the Second Snapshot
  Details:
    TestName: testDirPresentInSecondSnapshot.
    Description: This test checks if the method correctly returns the description when a directory is present only in the second snapshot.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up firstSnapshot and secondSnapshot as two distinct Snapshot instances; firstSnapshot should be empty or doesn't contain the same directory.
    Act: Call getDescription with DIR_PRESENT_IN_SECOND_SNAPSHOT_ONLY as the Target Enum and the two snapshots as parameters.
    Assert: Assert that the returned description is "Directory is present in [secondSnapshot] snapshot only:".
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the description correctly indicates that the directory is only in the second snapshot. This helps in identifying any new directories added that were not present in the first snapshot.
Scenario 3: Test Return Description When File is Present Only in the First Snapshot
  Details:
    TestName: testFilePresentInFirstSnapshot.
    Description: This test expects the method to correctly return the description when a file is present only in the first snapshot.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up firstSnapshot and secondSnapshot as two distinct Snapshot instances; secondSnapshot should be empty or doesn't contain the same file.
    Act: Call getDescription with FILE_PRESENT_IN_FIRST_SNAPSHOT_ONLY as the Target Enum and snapshots as parameters.
    Assert: Assert that the returned description is "File is present in [firstSnapshot] snapshot only:".
  Validation:
    The test verifies that the description correctly identifies that a file is present only in the first snapshot. It helps in ensuring data consistency across snapshots, which is important for maintaining data integrity.
Scenario 4: Test Return Description When File is Present Only in the Second Snapshot
  Details:
    TestName: testFilePresentInSecondSnapshot.
    Description: This test checks if the method correctly returns the description when a file is present only in the second snapshot.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up firstSnapshot and secondSnapshot as two distinct snapshot instances; firstSnapshot should be empty or doesn't contain the same file.
    Act: Call getDescription with FILE_PRESENT_IN_SECOND_SNAPSHOT_ONLY as the Target Enum and the two snapshots as parameters.
    Assert: Assert that the returned description is "File is present in [secondSnapshot] snapshot only:".
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the method correctly indicates that the file is only in the second snapshot. This information is important for identifying any newly added files.
Scenario 5: Test Return Description for Default Case
  Details:
    TestName: testDefaultCase.
    Description: This test checks if the method correctly returns the description for the default case.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up firstSnapshot and secondSnapshot as two distinct snapshot instances.
    Act: Call getDescription with an Enum value not listed amongst the cases and the two snapshots.
    Assert: Assert that the returned description is "Different files:".
  Validation:
    This assertion checks the default case handling by the method. This scenario is important in instances when files in the snapshots are different but none of the prior cases apply.
