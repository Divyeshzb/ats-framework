"""
  Scenario 1: Test differenceType when no difference is present between snapshots

  Details:
    TestName: testNoDifferenceType
    Description: The test is aiming to check the scenario when no differences are present between snapshots. So, the expected result should be null as no snapshot has any difference.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create instance of FileTrace. Add similar data in both snapshots using addDifference method.
    Act: Invoke getDifferenceType method.
    Assert: Assert that the getDifferenceType method returns null.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that when no difference present between the snapshots, getDifferenceType returns null. It's aligned with the expected behavior described in our logic.

  Scenario 2: Test file differences are detected correctly in first snapshot only

  Details:
    TestName: testFileDifferenceInFirstSnapshot
    Description: Testing whether the method accurately determine differences when entities are only present in the first snapshot.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a FileTrace instance. Provide a file path to the firstEntityPath. Ensure the secondEntityPath is null.
    Act: Call the getDifferenceType method.
    Assert: Confirm that the getDifferenceType's output is FILE_PRESENT_IN_FIRST_SNAPSHOT_ONLY.
  Validation:
    We're validating here that the entity can accurately mark a file as being present in only the first snapshot, which is valuable for finding discrepancies.

  Scenario 3: Test directory differences are detected correctly in the second snapshot only

  Details:
    TestName: testDirectoryDifferenceInSecondSnapshot
    Description: Testing whether the method accurately determine differences when entities are only present in the second snapshot.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a FileTrace instance. Provide a directory path to the secondEntityPath. Ensure the firstEntityPath is null.
    Act: Call the getDifferenceType method.
    Assert: Confirm that the getDifferenceType's output is DIR_PRESENT_IN_SECOND_SNAPSHOT_ONLY.
  Validation:
    We're validating here that the entity can accurately mark a directory as being present in only the second snapshot, which is valuable for identifying discrepancies.

  Scenario 4: Test file and directory differences are detected correctly in both snapshots

  Details:
    TestName: testFileAndDirectoryDifferencesInBothSnapshots
    Description: Testing if the method can accurately detect differences when entities are present in both snapshots but have different attributes.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a FileTrace instance. Add different attributes to the same entity (a file or directory) in both snapshots.
    Act: Call the getDifferenceType() method.
    Assert: Verify that the getDifferenceType returns DIFFERENT_FILES.
  Validation:
    This confirms that the getDifferenceType function can accurately recognize entities (file or directory) with different attributes across snapshots. This is crucial for identifying and resolving discrepancies.
