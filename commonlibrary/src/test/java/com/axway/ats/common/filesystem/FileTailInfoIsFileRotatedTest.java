Scenario 1: Test if the isFileRotated() correctly checks file rotation status

Details:
  TestName: shouldRecognizeFileRotationStatus
  Description: The test is meant to check if the method isFileRotated() correctly recognizes when a file rotation has been detected. We use this method to determine if a file has been rotated (i.e., its current size is smaller than the previous one).

Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the FileTailInfo entity and simulate a condition where the file has been rotated.
  Act: Invoke the isFileRotated() method on the instantiated entity.
  Assert: Use the assertEquals() method from JUnit to verify if the method returns the correct boolean value (true).

Validation:
  The assertion verifies if the isFileRotated() method determines the correct rotation status of the file. This is expected because we set up the entity, indicating the file has been rotated. The test is significant in the context of ensuring the robustness of file monitoring and management mechanisms in the system.


Scenario 2: Test if isFileRotated() correctly recognizes no file rotation

Details:
  TestName: shouldIdentifyNoFileRotation
  Description: The test is to check if the method isFileRotated() recognizes when a file rotation has not occurred (i.e., its current size is not smaller than the previous one).

Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the FileTailInfo entity and simulate a condition where the file has not been rotated.
  Act: Invoke the isFileRotated() method on the instantiated entity.
  Assert: Use the assertEquals() method from JUnit to verify if the method returns the correct boolean value (false).

Validation:
  The assertion verifies if the isFileRotated() method recognizes that the file has not been rotated. This is expected because the condition was simulated without any file rotation. The test is significant in ensuring the algorithmâ€™s accuracy and improving the efficiency of file monitoring and management tasks.
