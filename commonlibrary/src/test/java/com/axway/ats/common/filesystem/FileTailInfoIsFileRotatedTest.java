"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if rotation detection is enabled when file is not rotated
Details:
  TestName: testRotationDetectionDisabled
  Description: This test will validate if the isFileRotated() returns false when the file has not been rotated i.e., isFileRotated=false.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set isFileRotated to false.
    Act: Invoke the isFileRotated() method.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is false.
  Validation:
    This test validates that proper file detection is not guaranteed as the file might have been rotated and the new size might already be bigger than the previous one. It should return false when no rotation is detected and thus validates the correct functionality of the method under these circumstances.

Scenario 2: Test to confirm rotation detection when the file has been rotated
Details:
  TestName: testRotationDetectionEnabled
  Description: This test will check if the isFileRotated() returns true when file has been rotated i.e., isFileRotated=true.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set isFileRotated to true.
    Act: Call the isFileRotated() method.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is true.
  Validation:
    This test makes sure that isFileRotated() is functioning as expected by returning true when a rotation has been detected. The test verifies if the involves detection of the rotation and therefore checks if the method is functioning as expected.

Scenario 3: Testing the negative scenario where the wrong value is set to isFileRotated field
Details:
  TestName: testFaultyRotationDetection
  Description: This test will check if the isFileRotated() behaves as expected & returns false even when isFileRotated=true.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set isFileRotated to true.
    Act: Call the isFileRotated() method.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is not False.
  Validation:
    This test makes sure that proper functioning of the isFileRotated() is maintained even if faulty or wrong values are set in the isFileRotated field. The test case makes sure that the system is robust and does not display erroneous behavior during incorrect use.
