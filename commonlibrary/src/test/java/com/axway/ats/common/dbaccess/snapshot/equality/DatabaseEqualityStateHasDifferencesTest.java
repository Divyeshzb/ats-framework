"""
Scenario 1: Check if there are no differences between the snapshots.

Details:
  TestName: testHasNoDifferences
  Description: This test verifies if there are no differences found between two database snapshots. All variables are empty, simulating a scenario where both snapshots are exactly the same, with no differences in tables, primary keys, number of rows, columns, indexes, etc.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DatabaseEqualityState instance with empty fields for tablePresentInOneSnapshotOnly, differentPrimaryKeys, differentNumberOfRows, rowPresentInOneSnapshotOnly, columnPresentInOneSnapshotOnly, and indexPresentInOneSnapshotOnly.
  Act: Call the hasDifferences() method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the return value is false.

Validation:
  This test verifies that the hasDifferences method correctly returns false when there are no differences between the snapshots. In the context of the application behaviour, an accurate comparison of snapshots is essential to maintain the consistency and integrity of the database.


Scenario 2: Check if there are differences in only one aspect between the snapshots.

Details:
  TestName: testHasDifferencesInOneField
  Description: This test verifies if the hasDifferences() method identifies the differences when there are disparities in just one field (i.e., tablePresentInOneSnapshotOnly).

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of DatabaseEqualityState where all fields are empty except for tablePresentInOneSnapshotOnly which contains one table unique to a snapshot.
  Act: Call the hasDifferences() method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the return value is true.

Validation:
  This test asserts that hasDifferences() can accurately detect differences even if they exist only in one aspect. The presence of any discrepancy between the snapshots, no matter how small, must be flagged by the method.


Scenario 3: Check if there are differences in multiple facets between the snapshots.

Details:
  TestName: testHasDifferencesInMultipleFields
  Description: This test verifies if the hasDifferences() method spots differences when there are disparities in multiple fields (i.e., differentPrimaryKeys, differentNumberOfRows, etc).

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of DatabaseEqualityState where multiple fields are different in the two snapshots.
  Act: Invoke hasDifferences() on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the return method is true.

Validation:
  This test ensures that hasDifferences(), when called upon, accurately spots differences that exist across multiple aspects between two snapshots. The ability of the method to spot complex differences enhances the dependability and veracity of our database management system.
