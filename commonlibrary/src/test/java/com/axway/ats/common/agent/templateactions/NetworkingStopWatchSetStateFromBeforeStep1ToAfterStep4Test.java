"""
Scenario 1: Test scenario to verify successful start and suspension of timer and if timer value is less than or equal to 20 ms.

  Details:
    TestName: testNormalTimerStartAndSuspend.
    Description: This test verifies the normal operation of the method setStateFromBeforeStep1ToAfterStep4. The main goal is to ensure that the times for starting and suspending the timer are correctly set, and the timer value is less than or equal to 20 milliseconds is working effectively.

  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of NetworkingStopWatch. Invoke step0_SetNewContext with a given action name to initialize all timers.
    Act: Invoke the method setStateFromBeforeStep1ToAfterStep4.
    Assert: Assert the value of timerNetAndServerProcessingTime using the getNetworkingTime method, to check if it is less than or equal to 20ms.

  Validation:
    This assertion verifies the timer was started and suspended correctly and its value is less than or equal to 20 milliseconds. This test is significant because it ensures the network timer's correct functionality and its interaction with the system processing time.

Scenario 2: Test scenario to verify the logging of a warning when timer value is more than 20 ms.

  Details:
    TestName: testHighTimerValueWarning.
    Description: This test is meant to check the warning logging functionality when the timer value is higher than 20 milliseconds, indicating possible system overload.

  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of NetworkingStopWatch. Invoke step0_SetNewContext with a given action name to initialize all timers. Manually set the timerNetAndServerProcessingTime to a value greater than 20 ms if possible.
    Act: Invoke the method setStateFromBeforeStep1ToAfterStep4.
    Assert: Assert the existence of the warning message in the log.

  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the system correctly logs a warning message when the timer value is greater than 20 milliseconds, signaling a possible overloading situation in the system. This test is critical in ensuring the application's robustness and resilience under heavy load.

Scenario 3: Test scenario to check for system behavior when there is an exception while setting the state of the timer.

  Details:
    TestName: testExceptionDuringStateSetting.
    Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the method when an exception occurs during the state setting of the timer.

  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock an exception during the execution of setStateFromBeforeStep1ToAfterStep4 method.
    Act: Invoke the method setStateFromBeforeStep1ToAfterStep4.
    Assert: Assert if an exception has been thrown.

  Validation:
    This assertion ensures that the system handles exceptions properly that can occur during the state setting of the timer. This is crucial for the reliability and stability of the application.
