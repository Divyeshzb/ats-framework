ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=step9_endReceivingResponseData_25109e1619

Scenario 1: Ensure Timer Stop Event

Details:
  TestName: endReceivingResponseDataStopsTheTimer.
  Description: Test to check if the method "step9_endReceivingResponseData" stops the timer as expected.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a NetworkingStopWatch object. Invoke the method step1_OpenConnectionForRequest() to start the timer and then call the step2_OpenedConnectionForRequest() to suspend the timer.
  Act: Invoke the method step9_endReceivingResponseData().
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the timerNetAndServerProcessingTime is stopped.
Validation:
  Assert aims to verify that the timer has stopped as expected after the method invocation. This is important to ensure the stopwatch performs its function correctly, correctly measuring time for network processes.

Scenario 2: Timer Stop While Timer is Already Stopped

Details:
  TestName: endReceivingResponseDataWhileTimerAlreadyStopped.
  Description: To check if any unexpected behavior occurs if the step9_endReceivingResponseData() is called when the timer is already in a stopped state.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a NetworkingStopWatch object. Start and stop the timer using step1_OpenConnectionForRequest() and step9_endReceivingResponseData() respectively.
  Act: Invoke step9_endReceivingResponseData() once again.
  Assert: Assert that no Exceptions are thrown.
Validation:
  The test is to check if the method can handle being called when the timer is already stopped. It's important to ensure the robustness of the function and that it won't cause unintended effects on the application's performance.

Scenario 3: Timer Stop Without Starting Timer

Details:
  TestName: endReceivingResponseDataWithoutStartingTimer.
  Description: Test to check if any unexpected behavior occurs if the method step9_endReceivingResponseData() is called without initializing the timer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a NetworkingStopWatch object without starting the timer using step1_OpenConnectionForRequest().
  Act: Invoke step9_endReceivingResponseData().
  Assert: Assert that no Exceptions are thrown.
Validation:
  The test is to verify that method doesn't throw any exceptions or errors when called if the timer was not previously started. This will help ensure the stability and fault tolerance of the application.

Please note that these scenarios are dependent on the implementation of StopWatch, due to which the direct verification of time and state is not possible. For actual implementation of these test cases, the StopWatch will need to be replaced with a mocked object providing same interfaces and then the mock can be validated for the calls to start(), stop() and other methods.
