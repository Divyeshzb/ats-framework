"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if identical tables with same properties are treated as same
Details:
  TestName: isSameWithSamePropertiesTest.
  Description: This test checks if the isSame method correctly identifies two identical tables with same properties to be same.
  Execution:
    Arrange: We must first create a table name string with the same value twice and two identical properties.
    Act: Invoke the isSame() method with both table names and properties as parameters.
    Assert: Check if the result of the isSame() method call is true.
  Validation:
    The returned result should be true since both the tables and their properties are identical. This test helps ensure that the method handles standard cases correctly.
Scenario 2: Test to check if different tables with same properties are treated as different
Details:
  TestName: isSameWithDifferentTablesTest.
  Description: This test verifies if the isSame method correctly treats tables with different names but the same properties as different.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two different table name strings and two identical properties.
    Act: Invoke the isSame() method with the two different table names and two identical properties as parameters.
    Assert: Check if the result of the isSame() method call is false.
  Validation:
    Even though the properties are identical, the tables are different and hence the method should return false. This test ensures that the method correctly identifies different tables.
Scenario 3: Test to check if identical tables with different properties are treated as different
Details:
  TestName: isSameWithDifferentPropertiesTest.
  Description: This test verifies if the method treats identical tables having different properties as different.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a table name string with the same value twice and two different properties.
    Act: Invoke the isSame() method with the two identical tables and different properties as parameters.
    Assert: Check if the result of the isSame() method call is false.
  Validation:
    Despite the tables being identical, their properties are different hence the method should return false. This test ensures that the method correctly identifies differently indexed tables.
Scenario 4: Test to check if null parameters are handled properly
Details:
  TestName: isSameWithNullParametersTest.
  Description: This test verifies if the method handles null inputs for both properties and table names correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Intentionally pass null values for both properties and table names.
    Act: Invoke the isSame() method with null inputs.
    Assert: Assert that the method does not throw any exceptions and returns the expected value.
  Validation:
    The method should properly handle null inputs and not crash the application. This test ensures that the method is robust in handling edge input cases.

Scenario 5: Test to check if empty property inputs are handled properly
Details:
  TestName: isSameWithEmptyPropertiesTest.
  Description: This test checks how the method handles cases with empty properties.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two table names and deliberately pass empty properties for both the inputs.
    Act: Invoke the isSame() method with the created strings and empty properties.
    Assert: Assert that the method does not throw any exceptions and returns the correct result.
  Validation:
    The method should properly handle empty properties and not crash the application. This test ensures that the method is robust in handling specific property input cases.
