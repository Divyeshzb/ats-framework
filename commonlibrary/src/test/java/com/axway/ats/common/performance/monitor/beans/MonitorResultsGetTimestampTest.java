Scenario 1: Validating timestamp return value

Details:
  TestName: testReturnTimestamp
  Description: The test scenario is designed to validate if the getTimestamp() call from MonitorResults properly returns the timestamp variable.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a MonitorResult object, set a timestamp (we assume there would be a method for setting a timestamp as it is not explicitly provided in the problem).
  Act: Call the getTimestamp() method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned timestamp is the same as the one we previously set.
Validation:
  This test scenario checks that the returned timestamp is correctly retrieved from the MonitorResult object. The expected value is the same as the value we set to ensure the getTimestamp() method works properly. If the test passes, it confirms that the getTimestamp method retrieves the timestamp as expected.

Scenario 2: Validating timestamp return type

Details:
  TestName: testTimestampValueType
  Description: This test scenario is meant to check whether the return type of the getTimestamp method is a Long type as expected.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate MonitorResults object.
  Act: Invoke getTimestamp method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned timestamp value is indeed of type long.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the returned type from getTimestamp is Long. By guaranteeing the method's return type consistency, we keep the codebase robust and avoid potential runtime type conflicts.

Scenario 3: Validating null timestamp

Details:
  TestName: testNullTimestamp
  Description: This scenario is intended to check how the getTimestamp method behaves if no timestamp value is set in the MonitorResults object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a MonitorResults object without setting any timestamp.
  Act: Invoke the getTimestamp method.
  Assert: Assert whether the returned timestamp is null or a default value.
Validation:
  The test aims to verify edge cases such as the behavior of the method when the timestamp is not set. Depending on the MonitorResults class implementation, the test could either expect a null or a default long value. It helps to identify potential NullPointerExceptions and other unpredictable behaviors.
