Scenario 1: Basic Test Case for getId() method

Details:
  TestName: testReadingBeanGetId.
  Description: This test is designed to test the getId() method of the ReadingBean class to ensure that it is functioning as designed by returning the correct 'id' value of the ReadingBean instance. It is a basic scenario where we will test if the getId function correctly returns the id of the ReadingBean object.
Execution:
  Arrange: A ReadingBean object is created with an 'id' is set via the setId() method.
  Act: Invoke the getId() method to get the 'id' of the ReadingBean instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to determine if the getId() method returns the correct 'id' value that matches the value set using the setId() method.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to confirm that the getId method is functioning correctly by returning the 'id' set in the ReadingBean object. This is crucial as the 'id' is a fundamental attribute which may be needed for further processes or operations involving the ReadingBean object.

Scenario 2: Negative Test Case for getId() method

Details:
  TestName: testReadingBeanGetIdNegatively.
  Description: This test case aims to check if the getId() method handles exceptions and error situations gracefully. We try to invoke the getId() method without setting an 'id' and see if it returns an appropriate value.
Execution:
  Arrange: A ReadingBean object is created without an 'id' set; hence 'id' should hold the initial default id value.
  Act: Call getId() on the ReadingBean instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the getId() method is returning the default 'id' value (usually 0 for primitive int data type) when an id is not set.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to validate that getId() can handle the scenario when an 'id' has not been set for the ReadingBean object. This is important because we don't want the method to throw an unexpected error or exception when an 'id' has not been set. Instead, it should return the initial default 'id' value.
