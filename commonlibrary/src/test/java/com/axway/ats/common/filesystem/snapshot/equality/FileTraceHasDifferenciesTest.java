"""
Scenario 1: Verify the hasDifferencies method when no differences exists between the snapshots

Details:
  TestName: testHasDifferenciesNoDifferences
  Description: This test is meant to validate the function of the hasDifferencies method when there are no differences between the two snapshots.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two snapshots with identical contents.
  Act: Invoke the hasDifferencies method.
  Assert: Assert that the method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the function correctly identifies that there are no differences between the two snapshots. This is critical for correctly comparing snapshots in the application's use case.

Scenario 2: Verify the hasDifferencies method when differences exists between the snapshots

Details:
  TestName: testHasDifferenciesWithDifferences
  Description: This test is meant to validate the function of the hasDifferencies method when there are differences between the two snapshots.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two snapshots with different contents. The differences should be placed in the firstSnapshotDifferencies and secondSnapshotDifferencies maps using the addDifference method.
  Act: Invoke the hasDifferencies method.
  Assert: Assert that the method returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the function correctly identifies differences when present. This is key in accurately comparing snapshots and identifying changes in the target filesystem.

Scenario 3: Verify the hasDifferencies method when a single snapshot has differences

Details:
  TestName: testHasDifferenciesWithSingleSnapshotDifferences
  Description: This test is designed to validate the function of the hasDifferencies method when only one snapshot has differences relative to the other.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two snapshots where only one of them has unique contents. The unique content should be placed in the corresponding difference map via the addDifference method.
  Act: Invoke the hasDifferencies method.
  Assert: Assert that the method returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion is aimed at ensuring the function can detect differences when they only exist in a single snapshot, thus ensuring the robustness of the application's comparison capabilities.

Scenario 4: Verify the hasDifferencies method works with empty snapshots

Details:
  TestName: testHasDifferenciesWithEmptySnapshots
  Description: This test is designed to verify the function of the hasDifferencies method when dealing with empty snapshots.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two empty snapshots.
  Act: Invoke the hasDifferencies method.
  Assert: Assert that the method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies that there are no differences when comparing two empty snapshots, ensuring the integrity of the application's comparison operations across edge cases.
