ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=toString_bbffdadaa2

Scenario 1: Testing toString method with valid SSH algorithm, JCE algorithm, and key length

Details:
  TestName: testToStringWithValidInput
  Description: This test will verify that the toString method outputs correctly formatted Strings with valid input data.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of SshCipher with valid values for sshAlgorithmName, jceAlgorithmName, and keyLength.
  Act: Call the toString method on the instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the output is a correctly formatted String.
Validation:
  This test verifies the correct functioning of the toString method of SshCipher in cases where all required properties are set to valid values. A correctly formatted String as the output proves that the method is working as expected.

Scenario 2: Testing toString method with null SSH algorithm and JCE algorithm

Details:
  TestName: testToStringWithNullInput
  Description: This test will verify how the toString method handles null input for sshAlgorithmName and jceAlgorithmName.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of SshCipher with null values for sshAlgorithmName and jceAlgorithmName. Set a valid value for keyLength.
  Act: Call the toString method on the instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the output is a correctly formatted String, with null values represented appropriately.
Validation:
  This test verifies the correct functioning of the toString method of SshCipher in cases where the sshAlgorithmName or jceAlgorithmName are not provided. If the output string correctly represents null values, this means the method is handling null values as expected.

Scenario 3: Testing toString method with negative key length

Details:
  TestName: testToStringWithNegativeKeyLength
  Description: This test will verify how the toString method handles a negative key length.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of SshCipher with valid values for sshAlgorithmName, jceAlgorithmName, and a negative value for keyLength.
  Act: Call the toString method on the instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check how the negative value is represented in the resulting String.
Validation:
  This test checks the toString method's behavior when the key length is set to a negative value. The correct representation of negative values in the output string is the sign that the method can handle weird edge cases properly.

Scenario 4: Testing toString method with an empty string for the algorithm names

Details:
  TestName: testToStringWithEmptyString
  Description: This test will verify how the toString method handles an empty string for sshAlgorithmName and jceAlgorithmName.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of SshCipher with empty strings for sshAlgorithmName and jceAlgorithmName, and a valid value for keyLength.
  Act: Call the toString method on the instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the output is a correctly formatted String, with empty strings represented appropriately.
Validation:
  This test verifies the correct functioning of the toString method of SshCipher when given empty strings for the algorithm names. A correct output means that the method handles empty strings as expected.
