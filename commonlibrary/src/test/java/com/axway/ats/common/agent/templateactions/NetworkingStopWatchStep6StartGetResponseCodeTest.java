Scenario 1: Successful Suspension of timerBetweenReqAndResp and Resumption of timerNetAndServerProcessingTime

Details:
  TestName: testSuccessfulSuspensionAndResumption
  Description: This test is designed to validate that 'timerBetweenReqAndResp' suspends its counting and 'timerNetAndServerProcessingTime' resumes its counting after invoking the method 'step6_StartGetResponseCode()'. This is crucial in registering the correct time stamps for getting response code.

Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of NetworkingStopWatch will be created and the timers are started using the appropriate methods respectively.
  Act: Method step6_StartGetResponseCode() will be called.
  Assert: Verify if 'timerBetweenReqAndResp' has suspended and 'timerNetAndServerProcessingTime' has resumed.

Validation:
  The assertion aims to confirm that the suspension and the resumption of the timers function as expected in the process of getting response code. This ensure the time calculations are appropriately managed for subsequent steps.

Scenario 2: Edge Case for Suspension of timerBetweenReqAndResp when Already Suspended

Details:
  TestName: testDoubleSuspensionScenario
  Description: This test checks if calling 'step6_StartGetResponseCode()' when 'timerBetweenReqAndResp' is already suspended throws a meaningful exception or sets a valid internal state, ensuring the stopwatch does not enter an unexpected state.

Execution:
  Arrange: A NetworkingStopWatch instance is created with 'timerBetweenReqAndResp' already being suspended.
  Act: Method step6_StartGetResponseCode() is invoked.
  Assert: Verify an exception is thrown or a valid state is maintained.

Validation:
  This test is aimed at ensuring the robustness of the stopwatch. Double suspensions can cause incorrect time recordings which can be crucial in a network monitoring setup.

Scenario 3: Edge Case for Resumption of timerNetAndServerProcessingTime when Already Running

Details:
  TestName: testDoubleResumptionScenario
  Description: This test checks the situation where the method 'step6_StartGetResponseCode()' is invoked while 'timerNetAndServerProcessingTime' is already running and not suspended, to ensure that the stopwatch mechanism can handle such a scenario correctly.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of NetworkingStopWatch with 'timerNetAndServerProcessingTime' already running.
  Act: Call the method step6_StartGetResponseCode().
  Assert: Ensure that a meaningful exception is thrown or a valid state is maintained.

Validation:
  This test is important to check the robustness of the stopwatch under unusual conditions. A double resumption could skew the time recording, leading to inaccurate network timing results.
