ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getMonitorName_6ffdef6fe7

Scenario 1: Test to check the return value of getMonitorName method once the monitor name has been set

Details:
TestName: testGetMonitorNameAfterSetting
Description: This test is meant to check if the 'getMonitorName' method returns the correct monitor name after it has been set.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a new instance of ReadingBean and give it a monitor name.
Act: Invoke the 'getMonitorName' method from the ReadingBean instance.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the expected monitor name matches the monitor name returned by the 'getMonitorName' method.
Validation:
This assertion verifies that the 'getMonitorName' method correctly retrieves the monitor name from the ReadingBean instance. The expected result should match the monitor name that was given to the instance. This test verifies that setting and getting the monitor name work as expected in normal conditions.

Scenario 2: Test to check the default value returned by the getMonitorName method

Details:
TestName: testGetMonitorNameDefault
Description: This test is meant to check the value returned by 'getMonitorName' method of ReadingBean instance which hasn't assigned a monitor name.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a new instance of ReadingBean without setting a monitor name.
Act: Invoke the 'getMonitorName' method from the ReadingBean instance.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to assert that the returned monitor name is null.
Validation:
This assertion verifies that the 'getMonitorName' method returns null when no monitor name has been assigned to the ReadingBean instance. The expected result is null considering there's no default value for the monitor name. This test verifies the method's behavior in the absence of data.

Scenario 3: Test to check the consistent return value of getMonitorName method

Details:
TestName: testGetMonitorNameConsistency
Description: This test is meant to check if 'getMonitorName' method consistently returns the same monitor name each time it's called.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a new instance of ReadingBean and set a monitor name.
Act: Invoke the 'getMonitorName' method from the ReadingBean instance multiple times.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned monitor name is the same for each method call.
Validation:
This assertion verifies that the 'getMonitorName' method consistently provides the same monitor name across multiple invocations. This ensures the stability and reliability of this method.
