"""
  Scenario 1: Time Between Request and Response in Normal Case

  Details:
    TestName: testTimeBetweenReqAndResponse
    Description: This test is meant to check the returned time between the request and response in a normal scenario.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the 'NetworkingStopWatch' object, opening, and suspending the connection until the response is received. Set a realistic time for the response.
    Act: Invoke the getTimeBetweenReqAndResponse() method after setting the time.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the getTimeBetweenReqAndResponse() method is working correctly and returning the correct values. The expected result is a realistic time calculated by the stopwatch. This test is significant in the context of application behavior or business logic to evaluate the time required in a normal network operation.

  Scenario 2: Time Between Request and Response at Peak Load

  Details:
    TestName: testTimeAtPeakLoad
    Description: This test checks for the time taken between request and response when the system is heavily loaded.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instatiate the 'NetworkingStopWatch' object, opening, suspending, and resuming the connection under load until the response is received.
    Act: Use getTimeBetweenReqAndResponse() method after setting the time.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the prepared test data considering server load.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify being able to handle system load, returning an accurate time. This test checks for potential slowdowns or issues when the system is under load.

  Scenario 3: Handling of Zero Time Between Request and Response

  Details:
    TestName: testZeroTimeRequestResponse
    Description: This test checks whether the system can handle zero time between request and response, which can happen when interacting with local services.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up the 'NetworkingStopWatch' object to simulate a local service, ensuring zero delay.
    Act: Use getTimeBetweenReqAndResponse() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the returned time is zero.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to check the instantaneous response handling ability of the system. The expected result is zero.

  Scenario 4: Exception Handling of Negative Time

  Details:
    TestName: testNegativeTimeException
    Description: This checks the system's handling of situations where the time isn't valid - such as negative values.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up the 'NetworkingStopWatch' object and manipulate the system clocks after the request to force a negative time reading.
    Act: Invoke the getTimeBetweenReqAndResponse() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect an exception thrown by the method.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to confirm that the method throws an appropriate exception when negative time is encountered to prevent inaccurate readings from affecting other operations. The expected result is an exception.
