"""
Scenario 1: Test to ensure getCurrentPosition() returns the correct offset.

Details:
  TestName: testPositionOffset
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getCurrentPosition() method accurately returns the current offset. We will arrange situations where we know the position/offset and see if the method returns this accurately.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create known circumstances where the position/offset of the file is known.
  Act: Invoke the getCurrentPosition() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the method's return value to the expected position/offset.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method is accurately returning the expected offset. The expected result is defined by the setup context in the arrange stage. This test is meaningful as it verifies if the read operation is beginning at the correct position.

Scenario 2: Test to ensure getCurrentPosition() handles a file with no offset information

Details:
  TestName: testNoOffsetInfo
  Description: This test will deal with a scenario where a file has no offset information. This could occur if the file is empty or if no read operation had been performed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Arrange for a file with no offset information i.e., either an empty file or a very new file with no read operations carried out.
  Act: Invoke the getCurrentPosition() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure that the offset returns 0 or the default starting point.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies if the method can handle files with no offset info and return the default start position correctly. This test is useful as it checks the method's capacity to handle edge cases or ill-formed inputs.

Scenario 3: Test to check if getCurrentPosition() reflects changes after reading file

Details:
  TestName: testOffsetReflectionAfterRead
  Description: This test will verify if the method accurately updates the current offset after a read operation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Execute a read operation on the file at a known position
  Act: Invoke the getCurrentPosition() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned offset is the one immediately after the last read position.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies if offset changes get reflected immediately after a read operation. This test will check if the reading functionality is correctly integrated with the file positioning.
