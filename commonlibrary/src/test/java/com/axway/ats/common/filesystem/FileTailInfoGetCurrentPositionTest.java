"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if the getCurrentPosition method returns the current position of the file
Details:
  TestName: testCurrentPositionAfterInitialization
  Description: This test is meant to check if the current position returned by the getCurrentPosition method is zero immediately after initialization.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required for this test as we are testing after initialization.
  Act: Invoke the getCurrentPosition method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the position returned is 0.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the currentPosition is initialized as 0. The expected result is 0 because the default value of currentPosition is 0.
  This test is significant to ensure that the initial reading position is at the start of the file.
Scenario 2: Test to check if getCurrentPosition method returns updated current position of the file
Details:
  TestName: testCurrentPositionAfterReading
  Description: This test is meant to check if the current position returned by the getCurrentPosition method updates after reading the file.
Execution:
  Arrange: Read a certain number of bytes from the file.
  Act: Invoke the getCurrentPosition method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the position returned is equal to the number of bytes read from the file.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the currentPosition is updated after reading from the file. The expected result is the same as the number of bytes read because the currentPosition should update after each read.
  This test is significant to ensure that the getCurrentPosition method reflects the actual position in the file.
Scenario 3: Test to check if getCurrentPosition method returns correct current position even after file rotation
Details:
  TestName: testCurrentPositionAfterFileRotation
  Description: This test is meant to check if the current position returned by the getCurrentPosition method is correct even after the file is rotated.
Execution:
  Arrange: Rotate the file and then read a certain number of bytes from the file.
  Act: Invoke the getCurrentPosition method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the position returned is equal to the number of bytes read after the file rotation.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the currentPosition is accurately maintained even after file rotation. The expected result is the same as the number of bytes read after the rotation because the currentPosition should reset to 0 after rotation and then update with each read.
  This test is significant to ensure that the getCurrentPosition method correctly reflects the position in the file even after rotation.
