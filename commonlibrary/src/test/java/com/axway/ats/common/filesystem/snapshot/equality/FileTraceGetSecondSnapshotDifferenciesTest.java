"""
Scenario 1: Valid test to verify the correct differencies from the second snapshot.
TestName: verifySecondSnapshotDifferencies
Description: This test is meant to check if the method getSecondSnapshotDifferencies returns the correct map containing differences found only in the secondSnapshotDifferencies field.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of FileTrace and add differencies using the addDifference method for first and second snapshots.
  Act: Invoke the target method getSecondSnapshotDifferencies.
  Assert: Assert that the returned map equals the expected second differencies map.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the method returns the correct second snapshot differencies. The expected result is the same differencies that were added for the second snapshot.

Scenario 2: Edge case where no differencies in the second snapshot.
TestName: verifySecondSnapshotWithoutDifferencies
Description: This test is meant to check if the method getSecondSnapshotDifferencies handles the scenario where there are no differences in the second snapshot and it should return an empty map.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of FileTrace without adding any differences to it.
  Act: Invoke the target method getSecondSnapshotDifferencies.
  Assert: Assert that the returned map is empty.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the method correctly works in cases where there are no differences in the second snapshot. The expected result is an empty map as no differences were added to the second snapshot.

Scenario 3: Testing for differencies when both snapshots have differencies.
TestName: verifySecondSnapshotInPresenceOfBothSnapshotsDifferencies
Description: This test is meant to verify if the method getSecondSnapshotDifferencies correctly returns the differences only from the second snapshot when both firstSnapshotDifferencies and secondSnapshotDifferencies have differences.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of FileTrace and add different differencies to the first and second snapshots.
  Act: Invoke the target method getSecondSnapshotDifferencies.
  Assert: Assert that the returned map equals the expected second differencies map only.
Validation:
  This assertion checks that the method correctly isolates and returns only the second snapshot differencies even in the presence of differencies in both snapshots. The expected result is the map of differences that were added to the second snapshot.

Scenario 4: Test for the immutability of returned differencies.
TestName: verifyImmutabilityOfReturnedDifferencies
Description: This test is meant to check if the map returned by getSecondSnapshotDifferencies is a copy and does not reflect changes made to the secondSnapshotDifferencies.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of FileTrace and add some difference to the second snapshot. Then call getSecondSnapshotDifferencies and store the map in a variable.
  Act: Add a new difference to the second snapshot and call getSecondSnapshotDifferencies again.
  Assert: Assert that the map kept in the variable and the newly returned map are not equal.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the map returned by the method does not reflect changes after it was returned, hence preserving the snapshot of differencies at the time of invocation.
