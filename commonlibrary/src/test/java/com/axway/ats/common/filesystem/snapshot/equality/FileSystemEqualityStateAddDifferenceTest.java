"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if a FileTrace difference is successfully added to the differences list

Details:
  TestName: testAddDifference
  Description: This test will check if a new FileTrace difference can be successfully added to the differences list.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of FileSystemEqualityState and a new instance of FileTrace.
  Act: Invoke the addDifference method with the created FileTrace instance as a parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the new FileTrace difference has actually been added to the differences list.

Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the new FileTrace difference is present in the differences list. This test validates that the differences list is correctly updated when a new difference is added. This is important because subsequent processing of differences, such as sorting and analysis, is dependent on this method functioning correctly.

Scenario 2: Test to check if multiple FileTrace differences are added in the correct order

Details:
  TestName: testOrderOfAddedDifferences
  Description: This test will check if multiple FileTrace differences are added in the correct order they are received.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of FileSystemEqualityState and multiple new instances of FileTrace.
  Act: Invoke the addDifference method multiple times, passing in different FileTrace instances.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the differences are present in the differences list in the order they were added.

Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify the order of differences in the differences list. This is important for scenarios where the order of differences may influence subsequent computation or processing of these differences.

Scenario 3: Test to check if adding a null FileTrace difference throws an exception

Details:
  TestName: testAddNullDifference
  Description: This test will check if attempting to add a null FileTrace difference will throw an exception.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of FileSystemEqualityState.
  Act: Invoke the addDifference method with null as a parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if an exception is thrown.

Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that null values are not accepted by the addDifference method. This protects the differences list from being contaminated with invalid data, ensuring that subsequent processing of differences, such as sorting or analysis, can be executed reliably without encountering null values.

Scenario 4: Test to check if differences list can add and maintain large number of differences

Details:
  TestName: testLargeNumberOfDifferences
  Description: This test will check if the differences list can handle and maintain a large number of differences.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of FileSystemEqualityState and create a large number of FileTrace instances.
  Act: Use a loop to invoke the addDifference method with various FileTrace instances.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the differences list size matches the number of times addDifference method was called.

Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the system can maintain large differences list. This is particularly important in real world scenarios since the file differences may be numerous. A pass in this test demonstrate the robustness of our method to handle many different file traces.
