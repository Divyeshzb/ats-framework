Scenario 1: Testing whether the timer is suspended correctly after the connection is opened for a request

Details:
  TestName: testSuspendTimerAfterOpenConnection
  Description: This test aims to verify the method "step2_OpenedConnectionForRequest()", meaning to check if the stop watch timer 'timerNetAndServerProcessingTime' has been suspended successfully after the connection is opened for the request.

Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a NetworkingStopWatch object, and call the methods "step0_SetNewContext()" and "step1_OpenConnectionForRequest()".
  Act: Call the target method "step2_OpenedConnectionForRequest()" on the object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the 'timerNetAndServerProcessingTime' status is suspended.

Validation:
  This test is significant as it checks the correctness of timer functionality. It verifies if the timer is actually suspended when the connection opens for a request, ensuring that the application is correctly capturing the processing time for handling network request and response.

Scenario 2: Testing if an error is thrown when 'step2_OpenedConnectionForRequest()' is called before the timer is started

Details:
  TestName: testErrorWhenSuspendBeforeStart
  Description: This test is designed to check if an error is thrown when the "step2_OpenedConnectionForRequest()" method is invoked before starting the timer with the "step1_OpenConnectionForRequest()" method.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a NetworkingStopWatch object.
  Act: Directly call the target method "step2_OpenedConnectionForRequest()" on the object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if an exception/error is thrown.

Validation:
  The test asserts that an error should occur while trying to suspend a timer that has never been started. This ensures that application behavior is correct and protects against inappropriate method calls, enhancing system robustness.

Scenario 3: Testing the state of the timer before and after calling 'step2_OpenedConnectionForRequest()'

Details:
  TestName: testTimerStateBeforeAndAfterSuspend
  Description: This test aims to verify that the timer's state has changed after calling the 'step2_OpenedConnectionForRequest()' method.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a NetworkingStopWatch object and call the "step1_OpenConnectionForRequest()" method.
  Act: Save the state of the timer before and after calling the 'step2_OpenedConnectionForRequest()' method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the state of the timer has changed.

Validation:
  It is crucial to validate that the timer's state changes appropriately after opening a connection for a request. The test ensures the correctness of the application's behavior in measuring network processing times, contributing to accurate network performance monitoring.
