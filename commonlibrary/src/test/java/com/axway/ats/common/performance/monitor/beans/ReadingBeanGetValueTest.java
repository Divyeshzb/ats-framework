Scenario 1: Test ReadingBean getValue on a new instance.

Details:
  TestName: getValueOnNewInstance
  Description: This test is meant to verify that calling getValue on a newly created instance of ReadingBean, without setting a value, will return null as it should refer to the default value.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of ReadingBean.
  Act: Call the getValue method on the new instance.
  Assert: Assert that the return value is null.

Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that when getValue is called on a new instance which does not have a set value, it should return null as their default value. This is important because it confirms the behavior of ReadingBean in the absence of explicit initialization.

Scenario 2: Test ReadingBean getValue after setting a specific value.

Details:
  TestName: getValueAfterSettingValue
  Description: This test is aimed at verifying that the getValue method returns the correct value after calling the setValue method.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of ReadingBean and set a specific value using setValue.
  Act: Call the getValue method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the return value is equal to the set value.

Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getValue method correctly returns the value that was previously set. This ensures the proper functioning of the setter and getter methods of the ReadingBean which is crucial for data manipulation operations in the application.

Scenario 3: Test ReadingBean getValue after resetting the value.

Details:
  TestName: getValueAfterResettingValue
  Description: This test is designed to check if the getValue method continues to return the most recently set value even after a value reset.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of ReadingBean and set a specific value using setValue, then reset the value by calling setValue with a different value.
  Act: Invoke the getValue method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the return value is equal to the last set value, not the initial value.

Validation:
  The assertion intends to verify that the getValue method consistently returns the current value, even if the value has been changed multiple times. This is important in maintaining data consistency across the application.
