ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getEqualityState_8f17982054
Scenario 1: Testing method return when Equality State is null
  Details:
    TestName: testGetEqualityStateWhenNull
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the getEqualityState Method returns null, when equality instance variable is not initialized yet.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as the equality instance variable is already null.
    Act: Invoke the getEqualityState method.
    Assert: Assert that the returned FileSystemEqualityState object is null.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the getEqualityState Method returns null when the equality instance variable is null. The test is significant in ensuring that the method handles a "null" state correctly.
Scenario 2: Testing method return when Equality State is assigned
  Details:
    TestName: testGetEqualityStateWhenAssigned
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getEqualityState Method returns the correct FileSystemEqualityState instance after the equality instance variable is initialized or assigned a value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize or set up the equality instance variable.
    Act: Invoke the getEqualityState method.
    Assert: Assert that the returned FileSystemEqualityState object equals the one that was set up in the arrange step.
  Validation:
    This test verifies that the getEqualityState Method appropriately returns the value of the equality instance variable if it was assigned a value. This is crucial as it confirms the method's accuracy in returning instance variable values.
Scenario 3: Test method in multithreaded environment
  Details:
    TestName: testGetEqualityStateConcurrently
    Description: The test is designed to ensure that the getEqualityState Method delivered expected result even when accessed simultaneously from multiple threads. It also confirms if getEqualityState is thread-safe.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize or set up the equality instance variable. Create multiple threads.
    Act: Invoke the getEqualityState method concurrently from multiple threads.
    Assert: Assert that all threads return the same FileSystemEqualityState object, matching the one that was set up in the arrange step.
  Validation:
    The test validates that getEqualityState Method works correctly even when accessed simultaneously from multiple threads. This is important in the context of a multi-threaded application environment where multiple threads could be accessing the getEqualityState method at the same time.
