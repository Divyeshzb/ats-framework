"""
Scenario 1: Validate the getQuery method to see if it returns correct query string

Details:
  TestName: testGetQuery
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getQuery method is returning accurate SQL query string for DbQuery entity that has been set before.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DbQuery object and set a SQL query string using the setQuery method of the DbQuery object.
  Act: Invoke the getQuery method of the DbQuery entity.
  Assert: Assert that the query returned by the getQuery method is same as the query that has been set using the setQuery method.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getQuery method is correctly returning the query that has been set for the DbQuery object. This is essential for any operation that needs the SQL query of the DbQuery object.

Scenario 2: Validate behavior of getQuery method when no SQL query has been set

Details:
  TestName: testGetQueryWithoutSettingQuery
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the getQuery method when no SQL query has been set for the DbQuery object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DbQuery object without setting a SQL query string.
  Act: Invoke the getQuery method of the DbQuery entity.
  Assert: Assert that the getQuery method returns null or an empty string, assuming that the initial value of the query variable in the DbQuery entity is either null or an empty string.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getQuery method returns either null or an empty string when no SQL query has been set. This test is important for establishing the behavior of the method when no SQL query has been set.

Scenario 3: Validate the getQuery after changing the SQL query value

Details:
  TestName: testGetQueryAfterChangingQuery
  Description: This test checks whether getQuery method returns the updated SQL query after it is changed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DbQuery object and set an initial SQL query string. Then change the SQL query string using the setQuery method of the object.
  Act: Invoke the getQuery method of the DbQuery object.
  Assert: Assert that the getQuery method returns the updated SQL query string that was set in the arrangement step.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getQuery method successfully updates the SQL query that it returns after the setQuery method is invoked. This is crucial for any operation that utilises the SQL query of the DbQuery object after it has been updated.
