  Scenario 1: Validate that the getQuery method returns the correctly set query.

  Details:
    TestName: testGetQueryReturnValue
    Description: This test is designed to validate that the method correctly returns the assigned query value, in this case, an empty string since it's the initial value.

  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is needed as we are checking the initial value of the query.
    Act: Invoke the getQuery method.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value equals an empty string.

  Validation:
    Here we are ensuring that the getQuery retrieves the correct query value. This scenario is important to validate the retrieval functionality of getQuery method, an essential feature needed for the preparation of a PreparedStatement.
  Scenario 2: Ensure correct functionality even after query value modification.
  Details:
    TestName: testGetQueryAfterModification
    Description: This test checks if the getQuery method still returns the correct value after the query's value has been modified.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Use a setter or some other appropriate method to modify the query value.
    Act: Invoke the getQuery method.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is equal to the new query value.
  Validation:
    This test makes sure that the getQuery function always returns the current value of the query, supporting its dynamic modification. The query's successful retrieval after modification is critical to the application, as SQL queries are frequently altered based on various application conditions.
  Scenario 3: Check thread-safety of getQuery method.
  Details:
    TestName: testGetQueryThreadSafety
    Description: This test aims to verify the method's correctness under concurrent access which is important for a multi-threaded application.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create multiple threads that concurrently modify the query and then get its value.
    Act: Invoke the getQuery method in each thread after the query change.
    Assert: Assert that each thread gets the correct, latest query value it set.
  Validation:
    The test is significant for validating the method's stability and accuracy under concurrent access, an essential characteristic in multi-threaded environments. Invalid data retrieval under such conditions can lead to major application flaws.
