"""
Scenario 1: Test the OpenConnectionForRequest method without preparing context
Details:
  TestName: testOpenConnectionWithoutContext
  Description: The test is designed to check the functionality of the step1_OpenConnectionForRequest method without preparing context using step0_SetNewContext.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of 'NetworkingStopWatch' and do not call the 'step0_SetNewContext' method.
  Act: Invoke the 'step1_OpenConnectionForRequest' method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if 'getNetworkingTime' method returns 0.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that without setting up the context, the method 'step1_OpenConnectionForRequest' should not start the timer and networking time remains zero. The expected behavior assumes that the opening of a connection should start only after setting up the context.

Scenario 2: Test the OpenConnectionForRequest method after setting context
Details:
  TestName: testOpenConnectionAfterSettingContext
  Description: The test is intended to check the functionality of the 'step1_OpenConnectionForRequest' method after the context is set using 'step0_SetNewContext'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of 'NetworkingStopWatch' and prepare the context using 'step0_SetNewContext' method.
  Act: run the 'step1_OpenConnectionForRequest' method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if 'getNetworkingTime' is greater than zero.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the 'step1_OpenConnectionForRequest' starts the timer after the context is set. The expected outcome is based on the logic that the timer should start after the context is prepared.

Scenario 3: Test the OpenConnectionForRequest method after connection already opened
Details:
  TestName: testOpenConnectionAfterAlreadyOpened
  Description: The test aims to validate the functionality of the 'step1_OpenConnectionForRequest' method when the connection is already started.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the 'NetworkingStopWatch'. Prepare the context using 'step0_SetNewContext' and open the connection using 'step1_OpenConnectionForRequest'.
  Act: Invoke the 'step1_OpenConnectionForRequest' method again.
  Assert: Utilize JUnit assertions to inspect if the 'getNetworkingTime' method throws any exceptions.
Validation:
  The assertion explores whether the code handles the situation where the 'step1_OpenConnectionForRequest' method is called after the connection has already been opened. Depending on implementation, it should either handle scenario gracefully or throw an exception.
