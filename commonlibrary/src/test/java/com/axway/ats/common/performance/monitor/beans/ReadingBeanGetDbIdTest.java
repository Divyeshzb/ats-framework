"""
Scenario 1: Validate getDbId return type and value.

Details:
 TestName: validateGetDbIdFunctionality.
 Description: This test validates that the getDbId method returns an integer value. It is also checking if the returned value matches the set dbId.
Execution:
 Arrange: Create an instance of ReadingBean. Use the setDbId method to set a specific dbId value.
 Act: Call the getDbId method.
 Assert: Assert that the returned value is of the integer type and matches the dbId we set previously.
Validation:
The assertion checks whether the returned value is an integer and if it matches the set dbId. This will ensure that getDbId is working correctly and returning the appropriate values.

Scenario 2: Validate behavior when the dbId is not set.

Details:
 TestName: validateGetDbIdWithoutSettingValue.
 Description: This test checks what gets returned when the getDbId method is called and dbId has not been set.
Execution:
 Arrange: Create an instance of ReadingBean but do not set the dbId.
 Act: Call the getDbId method.
 Assert: Assert that the returned value is 0, as this is what Java returns for uninitialized integer class properties.
Validation:
The test case confirms getDbId's behavior when the dbId has not yet been set. This is a potential edge case and its handling ensures that the method behaves as expected.


Scenario 3: Validate behavior when the dbId is reset.

Details:
 TestName: validateGetDbIdAfterReset.
 Description: This test validates that after resetting the dbId, the getDbId method will return the new value.
Execution:
 Arrange: Create an instance of ReadingBean and set a dbId. Then reset the dbId to a new value.
 Act: Call the getDbId method.
 Assert: Assert that the returned value is equal to the res-set dbId value.
Validation:
This test case ensures that the getDbId method is correctly updating the value of dbId when it is re-set. In real-world scenarios, this can be useful when the dbId needs to be updated for any reason.
